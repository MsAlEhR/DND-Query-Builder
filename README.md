![face-realtime](./Rec.gif?raw=true "Title")

This is state of art query builder.In this project, I try to focus on people who  have no SQL knowledge and they want to define some rule or expression for running on databse.

### Run project
1- first clone the project

2-"npm install" By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json .

3- "npm start"  is a run command from your scripts located in your package. json file.
